 2.8 (Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy
      needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your
      program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the
      initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
      Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
      where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius,
      and energy Q is measured in joules
